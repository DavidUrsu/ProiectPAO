# Project Clarifications

- [x] Number of classes to be used: 5-6
- [x] Number of project queries: 7-8 (not just CRUD operations, something other than create, update, delete)
- [ ] Use as many concepts learned in the course and lab as possible:
    - [x] Exception handling
    - [x] Custom exceptions
    - [ ] Comparators
    - [ ] Lambda expressions
    - [x] It is not mandatory to use arrays, you can use only collections in the project implementation
    - [x] String builder/buffer
    - [x] Immutable classes (where applicable)
    - [x] SINGLETON pattern
    - [x] Basic concepts (abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism) -> methods from services and repositories should be exposed by interfaces (or abstract classes where applicable)
- [x] Expose a main class where queries can be called
- [x] Use file handling (e.g., audit executed operations, various data reports, etc.), at least one action with files
- [x] Models.Database part (the objects used for the model should be found in the form of tables defined in a database schema (e.g., MySQL)), relationships should be defined directly in the database schema (relationships between tables - one to one, one to many, many to one), and queries should be made through joins/subselects where applicable.

## Project Structure

- [x] Commands will be given by reading from the keyboard
- [x] No graphical interface is necessary!!!!!!
