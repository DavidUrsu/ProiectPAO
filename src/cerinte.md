# Project Clarifications

- [ ] Number of classes to be used: 5-6
- [ ] Number of project queries: 7-8 (not just CRUD operations, something other than create, update, delete)
- [ ] Use as many concepts learned in the course and lab as possible:
    - [ ] Exception handling
    - [ ] Custom exceptions
    - [ ] Comparators
    - pot face o sortare intre clienti care au inchiriat cele mai multe carti
    - [ ] Lambda expressions
    - [ ] It is not mandatory to use arrays, you can use only collections in the project implementation
    - [ ] String builder/buffer
    - [ ] Immutable classes (where applicable)
    - [ ] SINGLETON pattern
    - [ ] Basic concepts (abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism) -> methods from services and repositories should be exposed by interfaces (or abstract classes where applicable)
- [ ] Expose a main class where queries can be called
- [ ] Use file handling (e.g., audit executed operations, various data reports, etc.), at least one action with files
- [ ] Database part (the objects used for the model should be found in the form of tables defined in a database schema (e.g., MySQL)), relationships should be defined directly in the database schema (relationships between tables - one to one, one to many, many to one), and queries should be made through joins/subselects where applicable.

## Project Structure

- [ ] Commands will be given by reading from the keyboard
- [ ] No graphical interface is necessary!!!!!!
